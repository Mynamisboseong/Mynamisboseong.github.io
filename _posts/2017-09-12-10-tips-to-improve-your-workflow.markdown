###  Prolog
I naturally started programming as I pursued things I wanted to do.
Based on my brief experiences, I believe it's a blessing to be deeply fascinated and immersed in something. When you find something enjoyable and receive recognition from others, experiencing your own value increasing, it becomes addictive. Once hooked on this feeling, there's a continuous cycle of wanting to do better and create higher value. I've long believed that this cycle is a cheat code not only for developing skills but also for life, something you'll never regret. Discovering this cheat code was truly serendipitous for me, and I plan to continue believing in it.

### The quickest way to become familiar with computers is through gaming.

The first encounter with programming for me was 'games'. Since childhood, I've always loved computer games. I have an older brother who is 12 years older than me, and before I even started elementary school, I saw him occasionally playing games on the computer at home. Naturally, I was captivated by the allure of games myself. My first game was in the FPS genre, either WarRock or Karma Online—I don't remember which was the very first, but I do remember enjoying both.

I tried various games following my brother, and among them, the RPG genre was particularly fascinating. At that time, my brother enjoyed playing "The Kingdom of the Winds," and I followed suit, diving into RPGs.

During my elementary school years, I encountered two RPG games that were most popular among my peers: 'Dungeon Fighter Online' and 'MapleStory'. Meeting these two games marked the beginning of my journey into development.

Thinking back, it's quite amusing how these two games I encountered in elementary school led me into a career in development. Have you heard of AutoHotKey, a scripting language? It was my first programming language that introduced me to the world of developers.

### First Programming

As mentioned earlier, let's start with the story of Dungeon Fighter Online (DFO). In DFO, my character was a Spitfire class. Frankly, the name of the class isn't important. What mattered was the way my character attacked, which required me to rapidly press the 'x' key on the keyboard. Pressing and holding down the key didn't work for attacking; I had to repeatedly press and release it. The game was really fun, but at some point, my fingers started hurting.

Did I give up the game because of the pain in my fingers? No, absolutely not. Because I loved gaming so much back then, my focus was on how to make it more comfortable. The choice to give up gaming was never an option.

So, how did I solve the problem of sore fingers? What I wanted was a program that would automatically press and release the 'x' key when I held it down. It was during this time that I first learned about something called a "macro," which is a program that performs repetitive actions.

Once I realized what kind of program I needed, all I had to do was find it. I searched for keyboard input macros and stumbled upon the keyword "AutoHotkey." Interestingly enough, someone had already uploaded a blog post where you could download an 'x' key macro. Was it fate? I downloaded the macro I wanted and enjoyed the game much more comfortably. When I held down the 'x' key, it would automatically press and release every 0.2 seconds, exactly as I needed.

However, this joy didn't last long. I created a new character that required not only the 'x' key but also the 'a' key to be pressed rapidly. I searched again for a macro that could handle both 'x' and 'a' keys, but it was amusing that I couldn't find one that suited my needs perfectly. Naturally, such a macro didn't exist, so I pondered if there was another way. That's when I came across something interesting in a blog post about the 'x' key macro.

While browsing through the post, I discovered two attachments with the same filename but different file extensions. One was an .exe file, and as someone familiar with computers since childhood, I knew .exe files were executable files. In fact, I had used .exe files to run macros. However, the other file extension was .ahk, which was unfamiliar to me. Curious about what it was, I searched and found that running a certain program would convert .ahk files into .exe files. Later on, I learned that this process is called "compiling."

After realizing that .ahk files could be converted to .exe files, I hypothesized that if I could edit .ahk files as I wanted, I could get the .exe file I desired. Searching for ways to modify .ahk files, I found that I could simply open and edit them using a text editor. It was such a simple method. Although I don't remember the details very clearly from such a long time ago, I do remember editing script files with Notepad.

Opening the script file with Notepad revealed a flood of English words. Some words were unfamiliar and meaningless to me, but as an 11-year-old at the time, there were words I could understand. As I skimmed through the words, I noticed a combination of words near the word "while" that included the letter 'x'. Instinctively, I felt that modifying this part would give me what I wanted. I changed the quoted 'x' to 'a' and saved it. Finding a way to convert the modified .ahk file to an .exe file was not difficult, so I quickly did it. Finally, I ran the 'a' key macro I created and wondered if it would really work. I logged into the game with this thought in mind. When I held down the 'a' key, a whole new world opened up. The desired effect of pressing the keyboard 'a' key rapidly and tirelessly was achieved. This was my first experience with programming.
