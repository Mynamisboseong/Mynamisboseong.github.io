## No worries if you don't know coding, this book alone is enough to get you started in web development!

This book is designed to help coding beginners learn syntax quickly and enjoyably by selecting content primarily used in practice, combined with various examples. It covers everything from setting up the development environment to the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all in one volume. At the end, you will create your own portfolio page that can be practically used in the field, solidifying what you've learned. Moving beyond simple coding and result-checking explanations, the book enables you to understand the principles, so you can naturally grasp the concepts without memorizing. The content has been verified with a beta learning group to ensure it is explained at a level suitable for beginners, making it accessible for both coding novices and non-majors to start in web development.

Introduction:
Despite being a non-major, I started my career in Android/iOS development and have been walking the path of a developer for over 10 years, encountering and utilizing various languages in both front-end and back-end fields. Currently, I operate an online coding education site called SuCoding and a YouTube channel, where I continuously research ways to teach coding easily to many people.
