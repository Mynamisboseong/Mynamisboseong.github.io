## What should I start with to become a web developer?
To become a web developer, you need to go through several steps. Firstly, it is important to acquire fundamental knowledge of web development. You should learn web languages such as HTML and CSS, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap. Secondly, it is necessary to have advanced knowledge of JavaScript. JavaScript plays a crucial role in web development, so mastering it is essential. Thirdly, gaining experience by actually building websites is beneficial. By working on real projects, you can become familiar with actual development situations and enhance your problem-solving skills. Lastly, it is advisable to continue learning and self-improvement through development communities or online courses.

### How to Start?

The beginning of all web development starts with the very basics. I also began web development with HTML and CSS. I had learned about HTML at a gifted education center in elementary school, so I could start easily. However, even without such experience, anyone can quickly become familiar by reading a few books or watching lectures and creating something themselves. If you are starting from scratch, have never done web development before, and want to "try out" web development to decide your career path, I recommend using "Life Coding" or other online course platforms.

### Setting the Direction

The scope of web development is very broad. As such, there are many things you can do with web technology and many things you might want to do. If you want to become a web developer who participates in corporate team projects to create services, it is most important to choose which area of development to focus on. This means deciding on a field within web development.

Web development can be broadly divided into three areas: 'Front-End Development', 'Back-End Development', and 'DevOps Development'. Let's take a brief look at each.

* Front-End Development: Front-end development involves the 'visible part' of web services. In the past, it was limited to web design and creating responsive websites. However, with the advent of JavaScript libraries and frameworks like 'jQuery', 'React.js', 'AngularJS', and 'Vue.js', front-end development now plays a significant role in the speed and user experience of web services.

* Back-End Development: Back-end development involves managing and processing data using databases. Think of it as handling the 'functions' of a web service, such as login, sign-up, and forums.

* DevOps: A portmanteau of development (development) and operations (operation), DevOps is a methodology that involves collaboration between developers and operators. (by Naver Encyclopedia) In simple terms, DevOps engineers act as mediators who alleviate potential conflicts between developers and operators.
