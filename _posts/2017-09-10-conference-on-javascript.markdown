CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," which means a document that defines styles in a cascading manner.
CSS adds styles to HTML documents.
HTML documents have a cascading structure where tags contain tags, known as nested tags. Also, CSS needs to exist alongside HTML for a reason. While CSS documents (code) can exist independently, their purpose is to define the styles of structured HTML documents. Therefore, a CSS document without an HTML document is essentially meaningless.

* HTML: A language for structuring web document content.
* CSS: A language for adding styles to web document content (such as color, size, position).

CSS that is not used with HTML is just plain text, and to view the results through a web browser, creating an HTML document is essential beforehand.

* Property : Style the user wants to specify
* Property value: User-specified value among the types of styles
